# Recommender-System-Matrix-Factorization
Matrix Factorization is a simple embedding model.

Given a rating matrix R of dimension n x m, where m = no. of users and n = no. of items. The model learns 
1. User Embedding U of dimension n x k 
2. Item Embedding V of dimension m x k
where k = embedding dimension.

The notebook contains Practical Python Code for Matrix Factorization using numpy.
